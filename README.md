## Dataset

In the repository, we will provide the collated datasets and the generated knowledge cards.

In particular, because of the licensing issues involved, you will need to obtain the original dataset (we used the UMLS2017ab and UMLS2023ab version in this paper) from the [UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html) website yourself and convert it via script x to end up with a usable dataset.
